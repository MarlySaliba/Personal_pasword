# Personal_pasword
The initial goal of this project is to build a platform on which users can create their own passwords and usernames and then develop their own spaces.

## The first step
Program a password creator.

This part of the project must contain certain conditions:
1. The password must contain at least 8 characters
2. The password must contain at least 1 number
3. The password must contain at least 1 uppercase character
4. The password must contain at least 1 special character
5. The password cannot contain any spaces

If all of these conditions are respected then return an affirmation that the password is valid.

It is recommended to use a loop to make sure that you keep asking for a valid password.

## The second step 
Implement the functionality to generate a random password that meets all the conditions outlined in the previous step. 

The generated password must adhere to the same requirements as the manually created password while being fully random. In other words, each time the 'generate' button is pressed, a unique password should be produced.


## The third step
Program a username creator.
