# Personal_pasword
The initial goal of this project is to build a platform on which users can create their own passwords and usernames and then develop their own spaces.

## The first step
Program a password creator.

This part of the project must contain certain conditions:
1. The password must contain at least 8 characters
2. The password must contain at least 1 number
3. The password must contain at least 1 uppercase character
4. The password must contain at least 1 special character
5. The password cannot contain any spaces

If all of these conditions are respected then return an affirmation that the password is valid.

It is recommended to use a loop to make sure that you keep asking for a valid password.

## The second step 
Give the user the option to generate a random password that includes all the previous conditions.
